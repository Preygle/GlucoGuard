I have used the following data set to engineer my actual dataset for ml training

Context
This is a multivariate type of dataset which means providing or involving a variety of separate mathematical or statistical variables, multivariate numerical data analysis. It is composed of 14 attributes which are age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, oldpeak — ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels and Thalassemia. This database includes 76 attributes, but all published studies relate to the use of a subset of 14 of them. The Cleveland database is the only one used by ML researchers to date. One of the major tasks on this dataset is to predict based on the given attributes of a patient that whether that particular person has heart disease or not and other is the experimental task to diagnose and find out various insights from this dataset which could help in understanding the problem more.
Column Descriptions:
id (Unique id for each patient)
age (Age of the patient in years)
origin (place of study)
sex (Male/Female)
cp chest pain type ([typical angina, atypical angina, non-anginal, asymptomatic])
trestbps resting blood pressure (resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital))
chol (serum cholesterol in mg/dl)
fbs (if fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl)
restecg (resting electrocardiographic results)
-- Values: [normal, stt abnormality, lv hypertrophy]
thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
exang: exercise-induced angina (True/ False)
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
thal: [normal; fixed defect; reversible defect]
num: the predicted attribute

Context: The Diabetes prediction dataset is a collection of medical and demographic data from patients, along with their diabetes status (positive or negative). The data includes features such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. This dataset can be used to build machine learning models to predict diabetes in patients based on their medical history and demographic information. This can be useful for healthcare professionals in identifying patients who may be at risk of developing diabetes and in developing personalized treatment plans. Additionally, the dataset can be used by researchers to explore the relationships between various medical and demographic factors and the likelihood of developing diabetes.
This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.
Column: 
gender
age
hypertension
heart_disease
smoking_history
bmi
blood_glucose
diabetes

The actual features used were (gender,age,bmi,glucose level,diabetes,hypertension,heart_disease,heart rate,sleep hours,sugar level,cholesterol,systolic_bp,diastolic_bp,smoking_status,Step_count,drinks_per_week,stress_rating_1_to_10,Activity_Level,Alcohol_Use,Binge_Flag,High_Stress,Poor_Sleep,Stress_x_Poor_Sleep)


among them, the following features were enginenered
Formulas for calculation
gender: 1 = male, 0 = female
Activity_Level   - 0: 'Sedentary', : 'Moderately Active',  2: 'Active'
smoking_status = never → 0, former = 1, current → 2, ever → 3, not current → 4
random generated: Step_count, drinks_per_week, tress_rating_1_to_10
Activity_Level:'Sedentary': if Step_count < 5000,Moderately Active': if 5000 <= Step_count < 10000,Active': if Step_count >= 10000
high stress : stress > 7
poor_sleep: sleep_hours < 7
Stress_x_Poor_Sleep: high_stress * poor_sleep

i ahve used XGBoost to train my model(3 models for 3 different chronic conditions), i want you to create a proper readme that will aslo explain the working of
